## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [SA7SVR/Nextion_Screen](https://github.com/SA7SVR/Nextion_Screen/edit/master/README.md)

In this Repository you find my latest Nextion screens for HAM Radio!

1) ALL ScreenLayouts are for Basic & Enhanced screen models:

If you got an error that the files isn't matching your model, Check if you downloaded a version for your screen size
If you have the correct screen size downloaded, open that file with the Nextion Editor and select your model (Basic or Enhanced) in Device Menu, than save that file and upload via USB to TTL adapter or compile and transfer via SDCard to your screen!

2) Set the Port the way you have connected your screen (except for the Extended Edition, see the Wiki FAQ page for it):

  + USB             : dev/ttyUSB0
  + GPIO Raspberry  : dev/ttyAMA0
  + Board Pin-Header: Modem
  
3) Select ScreenLayout: ON7LDS L3

If you have questions or need support, got to the Wiki part (button on top of this Github page) or goto the Nextion Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/856674127831896/
